Question: 3

It is the 'forumng' activity type.


Your Query here:

select v.activity_type, sum(sv.sum_click) num_clicks
FROM studentInfo si
JOIN studentVle sv
ON si.course_code = sv.course_code
AND si.batch_code = sv.batch_code
AND si.id_student = sv.id_student
JOIN vle v
ON v.id_site = sv.id_site
WHERE si.final_result = 'Distinction'
GROUP BY v.activity_type
ORDER BY 2 desc;






Explanation (Optional):
Joined studentInfo tables with studentVle where the clicks are there and vle where the activity type is known. A specific 
implementation is that the while joining studentVle tables, I considered the same student to be unique by adding 
course_code, batch_code in the JOIN clause. Though the clicks got reduced because of speicificity, forumng remained the 
top exercised activity.
