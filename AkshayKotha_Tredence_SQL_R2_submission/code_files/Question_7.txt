Explanation (Optional):
The first table calculated weighted score across all assessments across different courses. As per the question, all 
the courses attended by a student id are taken into consideration to calculate the weighted average for that student id.
The second table uses the first table by join to sort the student ids after sorting them by number of assessments with a 
score of 100.
