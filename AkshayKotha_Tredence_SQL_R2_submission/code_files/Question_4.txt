Question: 4

studentVle file had 4 combinations of course-batch. 

I wonder if that's what you are looking for.

Your Query here:


WITH max_activity AS (
select course_code,
	    batch_code, 
		RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY course_code, batch_code ORDER BY sum_click desc) rank,
		date, 
		sum_click
from studentVle)

select *
from max_activity
where rank = 1;






Explanation (Optional):
Partitioned the table based on course, batch combination and filtered out the first-ranked click activity date.
