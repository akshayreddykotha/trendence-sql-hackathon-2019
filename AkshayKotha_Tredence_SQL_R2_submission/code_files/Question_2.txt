Question: 2



It is the course_code, batch_code combination = {AAA, 2013J} with the highest pass rate.
Your Query here:

/*Part 1*/
WITH reg AS 
(SELECT course_code, batch_code, COUNT(id_student) num_reg
FROM studentRegistration
WHERE date_unregistration IS NULL
GROUP BY course_code, batch_code),

pass AS 
(SELECT course_code, batch_code, COUNT(final_result) num_pass
FROM studentInfo
WHERE final_result IN ('Distinction', 'Pass')
GROUP BY course_code, batch_code)


SELECT reg.course_code, 
	   reg.batch_code, 
	   reg.num_reg, 
	   pass.num_pass, 
	   (pass.num_pass*100/reg.num_reg) pass_rate
FROM reg
JOIN pass
ON reg.course_code = pass.course_code
AND reg.batch_code = pass.batch_code
GROUP BY reg.course_code, reg.batch_code, reg.num_reg, pass.num_pass
ORDER BY 5 DESC;



/* Part 2 - Percentage of each activity type hosted within the course AAA, 2013J */

SELECT activity_type, cast(cast(count(*)*100 AS decimal(10,2))/
						   cast((SELECT count(*)
                                 from vle
                                 WHERE course_code = 'AAA' AND batch_code = '2013J') 
								 AS numeric(10,2)) 
							AS numeric(10,2)) perc_activity 
from vle 
WHERE course_code = 'AAA' AND batch_code = '2013J'
GROUP BY activity_type;





Explanation (Optional):
1. Two different tables, one for counting only registered students and the other for counting either 'Distinction' or 'Pass' 
students were joined as the pass percentage/rate was calculated. A combination of course_code and batch_code is considered 
unique. The course with the highest pass rate was [course_code, batch_code] = [AAA, 2013J
2. The activity split using the vle table in the course AAA, 2013J
