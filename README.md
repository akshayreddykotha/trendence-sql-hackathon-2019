# How did I import data?
This is pretty straightforward. Go through this [link](https://host4asp.net/import-csv-file-using-sql-server-management-studio/) and there are a lot of resources likewise which can help you import csv files into a database. Create a database beforehand on the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio interface.
